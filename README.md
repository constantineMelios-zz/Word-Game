# Word Game

### Decide if you can create a word from a random string of characters only by deleting letters. Become the winner by choosing correctly ten times in the row. Beware the time is limited and decreases in every round.

This game idea came from a Scrimba's Friday challenge. The challenge was to create a function that will check if only by deleting letters from a string you can create a specific word.  Find more here: https://scrimba.com/c/cdVyJRTr

I used two APIs to fetch a random word and string. Then a randomizer to decide if the answer will be true. According to the randomizer's answer, the word combines with the string in a way to achieve the right outcome. The challenge's answer is used as the final check.
